                <h3>Exploration</h3>
                <p>Hollow Knight is a 2d metriodvania centered around a bug is exploring a fallen bug kingdom. The knight must nagivate around the map and kill bugs as they go in order to collect soul, which allows the player to heal.</p><p>The controls are very simple, with the arrow keys to move, z to jump, and x to attack, as well as additional controls that the player unlocks over time while they explore.</p><p>Another important game feature of Hollow Knight is the charms that players can find and equip. Each charm gives its own unique perk, and oftentimes players will have one set of charms designed to make exploring the map easier, and another set of charms they use to help defeat bosses.</p>

                <h3 id="updates">Abilities</h3>
                <p>In Hollow Knight, the player can explore the map and unlock new abilities. A few major ones are: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mothwing Cloak (Allows player to "dash" in the air)</li>
                    <li>Mantis Claw (Allows player to jump off the walls)</li>
                    <li>Monarch Wings (Allows player to double jump)</li>
                    <li>Desolate Dive (Allows player to break through weaker areas of the ground)</li>
                    <li>Crystal Dash (Allows player to dash leftwards or rightwards until they hit a wall or stop)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>These abilities are very important for exploring all areas of the map and advancing progress in the game. Many areas of the map are only accessable to players with a specific one of those abilities, or even multiple may be required.</p>

                <h3>Bossfights</h3>
                <p>Hollow Knight is a game that is full of unique bossfights in which the player can challenge themselves to beat the boss.</p><p>The Mantis Lords are my personal favourite boss of the bosses that I have encountered so far. (Seen in the image on the right). In the bossfight, you initially fight one Mantis Lord, which acts as sort of a tutorial. After you beat the first Mantis Lord, the other two attack you at the same time. This bossfight requires a good amount of coordination as you can lose lives very quickly if you get disoriented.</p><p>The Mantis Lords have 3 attacks. The first is when they go to the side and charge at you. In order for the player to dodge this attack, they must jump. The second attack is when the mantis hovers above you and strikes downwards. In order for the player to dodge this, they must quickly get out of the way in either direction. The third and final attack is when the Mantises go to the side of the arena and throw boomerang like discs at the player, where the player must get out of the way to dodge.</p><p>When all these attacks are happening, the player needs to not only dodge the oncoming attacks, but also deal some damage of their own.  Below is a video of this fight.</p>
