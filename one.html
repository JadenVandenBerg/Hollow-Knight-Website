                <h3>Release Version</h3>
                <p>Hollow Knight was initially released on February 24, 2017. The initial inspiration from Hollow Knight came from a Game Jam in 2013, the theme of the jam being "Ten Seconds", where the player played as Hungry Knight (Also the name of the game), and fought bugs for food in order to not starve. It takes 10 seconds for the player to starve. The initial game can be downloaded <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/643636">here</a>.</p><p>As far as the actual Hollow Knight goes, the initial version contained most of the content that Hollow Knight contains today. The game functioned the same as it does now, with new updates adding new abilities for the character to unlock as well as new bossfights and areas. However, the main premise of the game remained the same. For more information see <a href="#updates">updates</a>.</p><p>You can play Hungy Knight over at <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/643636">Newgrounds.</a></p>

                <h3 id="updates">Updates</h3>
                <p>Hollow Knight has had 4 major updates with new content since release. They are</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Hidden Dreams (Released August 3, 2017)</li>
                    <p>The Hidden Dreams update brought the game two new bossfights, as well as a new ability to unlock, and the first Stag Stations, which introduced not only more content to the game, but a huge quality of life improvement that allowed the player to navigate around the map much quicker. The update also added several new enemies and two new achievements.</p>
                    <li>Grimm Troupe (Released October 26th, 2017)</li>
                    <p>The Grimm Troupe update added two new bossfights again, as well as some new enemies, new NPC's, and many new charms. This update added much more content than the Hidden Dreams update, however no major quality of life changes were made.</p>
                    <li>LifeBlood (Released April 8, 2018)</li>
                    <p>The LifeBlood update added a new enemy that when killed, allows the player to gain a small amount of temporary lives. The LifeBlood update also introduced players to a new bossfight, and also greatly improved the visual quality of the game. This update was small in terms of new content but made up for it with the newly improved graphics.</p>
                    <li>Godmaster (Released August 23, 2018)</li>
                    <p>The Godmaster update added a total of seven new bosses, a few new areas on the map, and several new items. This update is the biggest update content wise, but no major quality of life improvements were made.</p>
