                <h3>Info</h3>
                <p>Hollow Knight is a 2d platformer metroidvania. Metroidvanias are a type of game in which the player explores a large map and unlocks new abilities as the player progresses. These abilities typically allow the player to access new parts of the map. Hollow Knight is a very polished game, and from playing it, it's very obvious that the production wasn't rushed and that a lot of time was put into making it a very good game.</p><p>Hollow Knight was released on February 24, 2017, but since then there have been serveral major updates. Hollow Knight is an indie game by Team Cherry, an Australia based team of developers. There is a new game by the same studio expected for release in late 2023 called Hollow Knight - Silksong. The game features Hornet as the main character (one of the NPC's, and also a bossfight of Hollow Knight)</p><p>Hollow Knights soundtrack was composed by Christopher Larkin. The soundtrack consists of 26 tracks, as well as slightly different variations for several tracks (for example indoors/outdoors)</p>

                <h3>Cornifer</h3>
                <p>This is Cornifer. In Hollow Knight, Cornifer sells the player maps, which the payer can use to tell where they are in the area the map covers. After Cornifer sells the player the map, the player can explore more areas and add on the the map themselves. Cornifer can be found in new areas from the player hearing him hum his tune. Once the player gets close enough to Cornifer, they will be able to hear his humming, and can locate him from where the sound is coming from and purchase a map.</p><p>If Cornifer has left the area by the time the player gets there, the player can go to Dirtmouth and purchase the map from a shopkeeper for a slightly inflated price. It is always worth it to buy a map so you don't get lost in all the tunnels.</p>

                <h3>Stag Stations</h3>
                <p>In Hollow Knight, the Stag is used to travel around the map quickly. There is typically one Stag Station per area of the map so the player doesn't spend too much time travelling from one location to the next.</p><p>The game also has trams, which are like small shuttles that also transport players around the map. Interestingly, the Stag has some dialogue in the game in which the Stag says he doesn't like the trams, since the trams are a form of competition for the stag.</p>
